RT-dispatcher is a small utility that acts as pre-processor for Request 
Tracker email.  In the dark ages, the RT installation in my organization
was stuck behind a hosted POP3 server which we had little control over.
Since we couldn't set up aliases on the mailserver that directly invoked
RT-mailgate, we instead created aliases for all the queue addresses and
pointed them to a single POP3 account.  This account was monitored via
fetchmail, which invoked dispatcher.pl.

The dispatcher.pl script parses mail headers to determine the queue to
which a given message should be routed, and appropriately invokes
rt-mailgate to deliver the message to RT.  It supports multiple domains
and subdomains, so you can deliver (eg) webmaster@foo.com and
webmaster@bar.com to different RT queues, or the same queue, as you
please.  Spam is automatically shunted to a _SPAM_ queue, and mail not
addressed to a valid queue address can be bounced, logged or rerouted to
another queue for review.
