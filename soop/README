Soop is a process supervisor along the lines of djb's daemontools.  It will fork a child, 
execute the given process, and restart it whenever it exits.  Soop can also run 
user-defined tests at a preset interval to determine whether or not the child process 
should be stopped or restarted.  Logging is done to STDERR or syslog, user's choice.
