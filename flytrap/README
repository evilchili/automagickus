flytrap is a dropbox-like utility that shares a directory structure with
two or more remote clients by rsyncing changes to and from a server.
The server copy is always considered golden, so new clients will
download a changeset from the server when added to the pool.  After that
all local changes are sent to the server.  flytrap is ideal for sharing
a home directory between client machines where NFS or other traditional
filesharing isn't an option, eg. mobile devices without constant network
connectivity.
