rsync-backup.pl uses rsync over ssh to perform backups of remote systems.  
It supports multiple host definitions, allowing you to specify unique 
remote paths, exclusions, local backup targets and so on.  You can even 
mount a filesystem before starting the backup, and unmount it upon 
completion (dangerous for multiuser environments, but handy for toasters).

rsync-backup.pl is designed to be run from cron, for multiple daily
backups and optional archiving of daily, weekly and monthly snapshots.
Snapshots are done via hard links, so disk usage is minimal, and since
rsync only transfers changes since the last run, and uses compression to
boot, bandwidth requirements are light too.
